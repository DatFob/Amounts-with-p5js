							<h1>Lin Sanity</h1>
							<p class="major"><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4299/jeremy-lin">Jeremy Lin</a> grew up in Palo Alto, California. People had always doubted him when he was a young boy. He was born to two Taiwanese immigrants, and when people looked at his foreign ethnicity, they, unfortunately, doubted that he could ever play basketball. Lin learned the game of basketball from his father, who would teach him at the local YMCA. Even though Lin seemed to have some natural ability, he wasn't tall, which was one reason why people wrote him off. However, Jeremy Lin's performance during 2011-2012 season in New York, changed their minds.</p>

							<h2>Competing with Stars</h2>
							<p>In order to show Jeremy Lin's performance in the league, I created a stacked bar graph to compare Jeremy Lin with other top NBA players at the time such as Lebron James, Kobe Bryant (RIP) and Kevin Durant.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Points / Game : On average, how many points a player scores in a game.</li>
								<li>Rebounds : On average, how many rebounds a player grabs in a game.</li>
								<li>Assists : On average, how many assits a player dishes out in a game</li>
								<li>Efficiency: a composite basketball statistic that is derived from basic individual statistics: points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, and shot attempts.</li>
							  </ul>

							<h2>Money and Fame</h2>
							<p>New York Knicks isn't a top tier basketball team in the league. Therefore in 2006, the average ticket price is about 70$. However, we can see an increase in ticket price from 2010 to 2014 and a dramatically increase from 2010 - 2012. Lin Sanity happened during season 2011-2012 and it almost seems like such two events are correlated (they are).</p>
							<p>A Klout score measures an individual's social media influence. Using an app from the company Klout, users can connect various social accounts such as Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, etc., and then provides every user with his or her Klout score. The score is based on a numerical value of 1 out of 100--the higher the score, the more influence an individual has on social media platforms. Just to give you guys an idea, some celebrity who had a klout score in 80 - 95 range are: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Justin Bieber</li>
								<li>Robert Scoble</li>
								<li>Barack Obama</li>

						<h2>Whose money?</h2>
						<p>Though we just saw an increase in ticket price at the Madison Sqaure Garden. However, Increase in ticket price does not mean the players on the team will get a raise. Looking at the bubble chart on the right, the size of the circle indicates the amount of salary each player was earning. Yeah, it's ridiculous how little a player is paid when comparing to one of the super stars. Even though, they could be producing the same stats for their teams.</p>

							<h2>Shot Chart</h2>
							<p>Laslty, let's look at the shots Jeremy Lin took during his 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 season. The image on the right is his 2010-2011 season and the image on the left is the 2011-2012 Season. We can see that Jeremy is taking more shots as a player everywhere on the court. He has improved his play making, shot creation and shot taking as a better basketball player after his Lin Sanity period. It also emphasizes his importance to the team and coach's plays are evolving around him</p>
