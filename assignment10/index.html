    <p><b>Black Hat Covid Chart</b></p>
    <img src="/assignment10/image/bh_covid.png" alt="">
    <p>This is an example of misleading, poorly made with un-tested data. The bar chart suppose to display total covid cases out of one million population, the title is misleading itself. By looking at the chart, it almost seems like that Germany is having ten times as many covid cases as America. But this is not the case, this is caused by a poorly made x-Axis that starts at 280,000 but not 0. Therefore this bar chart is mainly showing the difference instead of the proportion of each country. It also doesn't tell the reader when was the data collected.</p>
